    Normalizes logits using a minimum power normalization approach.

    This function applies power normalization to the input logits, raising them to a power
    and normalizing to create a probability distribution. If the sum is too small (below epsilon),
    returns zeros to avoid division by very small numbers.

    Args:
        logits: Input tensor to be normalized
        power: Power to raise the logits to. Defaults to 2.0.
        epsilon: Small value to prevent division by zero. Defaults to 1e-8.

    Returns:
        Normalized probabilities
